In order to use this system, you must configure persistance.xml 
in the src/META-INF/persistance.xml
There is an example file in the META-INF folder to start from.


If you want to use slicing in the JPA system you need to add:
-javaagent:/path-to-rep/stockrobot/jar/openjpa-all-2.2.0.jar
to the JVM arguments.
