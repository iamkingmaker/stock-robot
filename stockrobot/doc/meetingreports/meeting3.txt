Participants:

1.	Objectives (5 min)
        	*Thursday:
            	=> At least one Use Case
            	=> Complete the first part of the RDD document
   		 => Show a GUI-mockup for our customer.
        	*One week goal:
            	=> We aim to have a working alpha prototype, together with a simple algorithm for testing all parts of the
   		 
        	*Presentation this day of RAD and domain-model.
 
2.	Reports (15 min)

        	*Erik have done what he was supposed to.
    	*Mattias has made an interface to the buy and sell api, he made a scheduler for the algorithms instead.
    	*Daniel got started on the JPA system, and will continue on it.
    	*Kristian has been very busy with a programming conference.
   	 
      	 
3.	Discussion items (35 min)

    	*We will need some kind of pulse from the Parser to the algorithms to know when theres new data available.
    	*We need to design so that the scheduler and the parser works good together.
    	*We have scale down the program abit, to have a working prototype.
      	 
4.	Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

        	* Long term issues
            	=> We will use Google Code's issue tracker
        	* Short term issues
            	=> Deal with the customer to know what he need in the alpha-version.
   	 	=> Show our customer our domain-model and RAD.
        	

        	+++ Specific delegations:
        	*Kristian
            	=> Open a SQL-server.
            	=> Program a scheduler.
=> Discuss with Erik about the design of how the Scheduler works together with   the parser.
        	*Mattias
            	=> Fix buy sell api.
   	            => Scheduler for running the algorithms.

        	*Erik
            	=> Merge Harvester with Scheduler.
		=> Split Parser into Parser and ParserHandler
   	            => Read up on the algorithms.
        	*Daniel
            	=> Will continue working the the JPA-implementation.
  	 
	5.	Wrap up 
Friday 23:th
            	* Discuss the outcome of the meeting in Thursday with our customer.
   		* Merge the program, so that we will have a working program.
