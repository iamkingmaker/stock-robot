Use Case: Simulation
Short description: This is the simulation usecase, here the user gets presented with a simulation view.
User selects an algorithm and sets algorithm settings.

Priority: Low

Extends or Includes: UC_Astro, UC_AlgorithmSettings, UC_SimulationStart

Participating actors: User, Astro

Normal flow of events:

User                                    System
----                                    ------
User selects an algorithm

                                        System overwrites the default algorithm

User clicks on algorithm settings

										Algorithm settings will start (see UC_AlgorithmSettings)

User clicks "start" button

										System lanches the Simulation (see UC_SimulationStart)
