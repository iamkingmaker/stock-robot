2.	Reports (15 min)

	* We have presented the iteration 1 program to the customer. The customer was so excited about out progress he gave us candy.
	* We now have a running parser fetching stock info from Avanza.se, and a client side stock robot that interacts with that data to buy and sell stocks and record the trade history
	* The client has expressed a wish that we start practicing test driven development, writing tests first and then writing code to make the tests pass.
	
	* Daniel has so far created a stock simulation handler
	* Mattias has fully mastered JPA and has also fixed and simplified the domain model
	* Erik has written classes to connect the parser and robot programs, to notify robots that data has been added to the price database
	* Kristian has implemented a JTable showing stock data from the price DB, removed calls to FinancialLongConverter from the trader and created a few junit-tests.
